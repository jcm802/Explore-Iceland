A work-in-progress personal project intended to be a prototype tourism website. 

See current website here: exploreiceland.herokuapp.com

======================
== Current Progress ==
======================

Landing and Home page are viewable.

Hand coded with HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Features Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose as the back end.

=== Functionality ===

The landing page directs you to the home page by clicking 'Start Your Journey'. Click the iceland logo on the home page to be directed back to the landing page. A mobile menu on smaller screens can be clicked and links viewed.

=== Progress ===

The landing page is finished. The home page is in progress and now responsive across devices. It also uses placeholder text. The website features front and back end capability. The database currently holds the landing page background images for testing purposes.

=== Objectives ===

The website will feature login and sign up capability for people to review and comment on places they have visited. Booking through an external travel agency will also be possible and the explore page will feature an interactive map. 

This is a continuous project, where I aim to implement full functionality, including a shop with e-commerce capability.

===== Designs =====

Designs are in place for both the home and explore page. Also for the landing page, but this was revised. The designs can be found in the directory "artboards". These demonstrate some intention of the project.
