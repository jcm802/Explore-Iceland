The mongo daemon must also be running to function.

==== Current Progress and Explanation =====

Only the landing page is finished. The website will feature front and back end capability. The current directories reflect a back-end node.js structure. It uses html, css, javascript, node.js, express, mongoDB, mongoose. It will feature authentication, with login and sign up capability for people to review and comment on places they have visited. It will give people the ability to book through an external travel agency and data from an api will be used in an interactive map on the explore page. This is a continuous project, where I hope to implement full functionality, including a shop with e-commerce capability.

The DB currently just holds the index background images, in case I need to use them elsewhere on the site for any reason and for testing purposes.

===== Designs =====

Designs are in place for both the home and explore page. Also for the landing page but this was revised. The designs can be found in the directory "artboards". These demonstrate some intention of the project.


===== html_previews =====

In the "html_previews" directory are strictly front-end versions of the site for a quick view of what it looks like in practice. "jquery_js_transition" is a version of the landing page where I made a transition with jQuery and JS. This was found not to perform well consistently, however it was good practice. "css_transition" is the front-end only version of the front and back-end version currently in progess. CSS used for the transition was more effective.
