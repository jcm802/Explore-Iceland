Most of the guided packages around the country include a stop at Gullfoss, such as this popular 6-Day Vacation, as do almost all self-drive journeys, like this 7-Day Winter Road Trip.\r\n\r\nBecause of the waterfall’s two stages, Gullfoss should actually be thought of as two separate features. The first, shorter cascade is 11 metres (36 feet), whilst the second drop is 21 metres (69 feet).\r\n\r\nThe canyon walls on both sides of the waterfall reach heights of up to 70 metres (230 feet), descending into the great Gullfossgjúfur canyon. Geologists believe that this canyon was formed by glacial outbursts at the beginning of the last age. - guidetoiceland.is","location":"Hvítá river, Iceland","tour":"https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Products-g7940590-d1740559-Gullfoss_Waterfall-Blaskogabyggd_South_Region.html","images":[{"_id":{"$oid":"61717b6b1df4b4adb2487afd"},"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp0ylwjhc/image/upload/v1634827110/Samples1/nee6udqfeuewaoacvxfz.jpg","filename":"Samples1/nee6udqfeuewaoacvxfz"},{"_id":{"$oid":"61717b6b1df4b4adb2487afe"},"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp0ylwjhc/image/upload/v1634827112/Samples1/flqsywvghjkbdw9pgqgc.jpg","filename":"Samples1/flqsywvghjkbdw9pgqgc"},{"_id":{"$oid":"61717b6b1df4b4adb2487aff"},"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp0ylwjhc/image/upload/v1634827114/Samples1/ogbavantq2wkchlfkexe.jpg","filename":"Samples1/ogbavantq2wkchlfkexe"}],"__v":5,"date":"17/11/2021","time":"16:14","dateTime":{"$date":"2021-11-17T16:14:00Z"}}

In fact, Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon and Diamond Beach are the most photographed places in Iceland.\r\n\r\nJökulsárlón is a large glacial lagoon at the foot of Europe’s largest ice cap, the Vatnajökull glacier. At the point where the melting glacier reaches sea level, it creates a large lagoon. As the ice melts, massive chunks break away from the glacier tongue.\r\n\r\nThese giant icebergs then move toward the ocean, floating slowly across the lagoon. This creates such an otherworldly sight that leaves no one untouched. The icebergs appear in many different hues. Some are an appealing blue and turquoise, while others are milky white. Many others appear transparent as if they were made of glass.\r\n\r\nThese thrilling natural phenomena are quite varied in size and shape. The biggest icebergs can be as large as 20 to 30 meters. The lagoon never looks the same. Tide currents, air temperature, and winds affect the movement and appearance of the icebergs. The view of this glacial lake can completely change overnight. - guidetoiceland.is","location":"Vatnajökull National Park, Iceland","tour":"https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Products-g12344476-d276577-Glacier_Lagoon-Jokulsarlon_East_Region.html","images":[{"_id":{"$oid":"61717e951df4b4adb2487b0e"},"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp0ylwjhc/image/upload/v1634827912/Samples1/zxw70e4ywa23i6uzecyw.jpg","filename":"Samples1/zxw70e4ywa23i6uzecyw"},{"_id":{"$oid":"61717e951df4b4adb2487b0f"},"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp0ylwjhc/image/upload/v1634827916/Samples1/fffe3ygprernshtmiyuq.jpg","filename":"Samples1/fffe3ygprernshtmiyuq"},{"_id":{"$oid":"61717e951df4b4adb2487b10"},"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp0ylwjhc/image/upload/v1634827923/Samples1/rol9q3y0bwkjnggkmsks.jpg","filename":"Samples1/rol9q3y0bwkjnggkmsks"}],"__v":3,"date":"","time":"","dateTime":null}
